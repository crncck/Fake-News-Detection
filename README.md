# Fake-News-Detection

Fake News Detection is a natural language processing task that involves identifying and classifying news articles or other types of text as real or fake.

This project aims to build a fake news classifier using [Kaggle Fake News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data?select=train.csv). The [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/crncck/Fake-News-Detection/blob/main/FakeNewsDetection.ipynb) contains the implementation of the fake news classifier with two different classifier models which are Multinomial Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier.
